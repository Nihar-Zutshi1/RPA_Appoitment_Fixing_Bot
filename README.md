## What is RPA? 
Robotic process automation (RPA) occurs when basic tasks are automated through software or hardware systems that function 
across a variety of applications, just as human workers do. The software or robot can be taught a workflow with multiple 
steps and applications, such as taking received forms, sending a receipt message, checking the form for completeness, filing
the form in a folder, and updating a spreadsheet with the name of the form, the date filed, and so on. RPA software is designed 
to reduce the burden for employees of completing repetitive, simple tasks..

## Key Takeways
- Robotic process automation (RPA) refers to software that can be easily programmed to do basic, repetitive tasks across 
applications.

- RPA creates and deploys a software robot with the ability to launch and operate other software.

- Designed primarily for office-type functions, RPA works like a digital assistant, doing routine onerous tasks that would 
otherwise eat up employees' time.

## Problem Statement:
In the Hospitals, there is a vast number of patients coming daily to get their health issues resolved, 
but having those patient registrations in manual log books or handing them out manual tokens will cause
a lot of confusion when the same patient keeps.

## Why we use RPA should be used for this?
Hospitals can’t waste their resources on keeping track of these details on a manual basis for a long time
hence such patient registrations can be done by the RPA software robots which have all the information 
required for them to guide the patients. Who turn up at the Hospitals for their treatment. 

There is always a possibility that these software robots be monitored for ensuring the process being followed 
in the right manner.

## Advantages of using RPA in Patient Registration?

   ● Reduce errors in registrations 
   ● Labour savings 
   ● Improved consistency and quality 
   ● Enhanced throughput
   ● These will save time
