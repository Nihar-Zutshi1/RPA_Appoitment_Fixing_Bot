## What is RPA? 
Robotic process automation (RPA) occurs when basic tasks are automated through software or hardware systems that 
function across a variety of applications, just as human workers do. ... RPA software is designed to reduce the 
burden for employees of completing repetitive, simple tasks.

# Problem Statement:
In the Hospitals, there is a vast number of patients coming daily to get their health issues resolved, 
but having those patient registrations in manual log books or handing them out manual tokens will cause
a lot of confusion when the same patient keeps.

# Why we use RPA should be used for this?
Hospitals can’t waste their resources on keeping track of these details on a manual basis for a long time
hence such patient registrations can be done by the RPA software robots which have all the information 
required for them to guide the patients. Who turn up at the Hospitals for their treatment. 

There is always a possibility that these software robots be monitored for ensuring the process being followed 
in the right manner.

# Advantages of using RPA in Patient Registration?

   ● Reduce errors in registrations 
   ● Labour savings 
   ● Improved consistency and quality 
   ● Enhanced throughput
